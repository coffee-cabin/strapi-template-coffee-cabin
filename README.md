# strapi-template-to-customize

Generally speaking, this repo is to be used as boilerplate code for creating and customizing a [strapi starter](https://strapi.io/blog/announcing-the-strapi-starter-cli) for your dev team.  

(Please see benefits of strapi starters in [this video series](https://strapi.training/videos/intro-to-auxiliary-benefits-to-strapi-starters), which goes over auxiliary benefits like: R&D, prototyping, and proofs of concept.)

NOTE: **This repo represents the required strapi _template_, that will provide the backend, strapi API** for our customized, strapi starter, detailed in this repo's instructional video (TODO: provide link to strn video).  

NOTE: This repo is a [strapi template](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/templates.html), **in and of itself**.


# Customization Instructions

For instructions on how to use this repo, please refer to this video (link to TBA), which contains instructions on how to create & customize your dev team's very own strapi starter, **and includes instructions regarding this repo**!  ðŸ™Œ

The video contains easy-to-access chapters and makes use of [kinesthetic learning style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesthetic_learning) by providing pause screens for hands-on exercises that keep up with the video content. 

# Customizable `template` Folder
The video (link to TBA) contains thorough instructions on how to use this repo, but this is a quick side note that the `template` folder contains a very basic, **strapi app** project that serves as a placeholder, **backend** app for this strapi template--again, which is intended to be used with a strapi starter.  

Please note that you can, however, replace the project in the `starter` folder for your dev team; and **this is encouraged**.  This way, you can have a boilerplate backend that fits your dev team's specific needs.  

That said, there is nothing to say that you can't also use it as a starting point for you dev team's needs. This is completely up to you! ðŸ˜‰

# Misc Notes
The code in the `template` folder was generated with the general starter, [create-strapi-app](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/tree/master/packages/create-strapi-app).
